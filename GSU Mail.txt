Hello Professor,

I hope you are doing well.

My name is Manyam Giri Preethi. At Georgia State University, I will begin my master's degree for the fall 2024. I completed my undergraduate studies at Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, Tirupati, India.

Upon checking out your profile on the university website, I was really impressed by depth of your research. It was clear to me that your work fits perfectly with what I want to study and what I'm interested in doing professionally. I believe I am a qualified candidate to work with the research team since I have experience in Programming, Databases and has keen interest in data analytics, machine learning, deep Learning and neural networks. I would be honoured to have the chance to collaborate with you if given the chance.

Being a research assistant as an international student not only gives me a solid foundation for the future, but it also stabilises my finances. My resume is attached, and I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

I appreciate you so much, and I eagerly awaits your reply.

Best Regards,
M G Preethi
