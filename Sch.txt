Hello Professor,

I hope you must be doing well.

Manyam Giri Preethi is my name. At Georgia State University, i will begin my master's programme in the fall 2024. I completed my
undergraduate studies at Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College, Tirupati, India.

I looked at your page on the university website and thought your work was fascinating. I believe I am a qualified candidate to work on the research team since I have working
experience in Programming, Databases and keen intrest in data analytics, machine learning, deep Learning and neural networks. I would be honoured to have the chance to colloborate with you if given the chance.

Being a research assistant as an international student not only gives me a solid foundation for the future, but it also stabilises my finances.

My resume is attached, and I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

I appreciate you so much, and I eagerly awaits your reply.

Thanks & Regards,
M G Preethi
