An empty interface in Java is referred to as a Marker interface.
In Java, when you declare primitive datatypes, then Wrapper classes are responsible for converting them into objects(Reference types). 
Constructor gets invoked when a new object is created.
Default value of byte datatype is 0.
Postfix operators i.e () [] . is at the highest precedence.
ParseInt() method:This method is used to get the primitive data type of a certain String.
---------------
While creating your own exception âˆ’we need to keep in mind that:
All exceptions must be a child of Throwable.
If you want to write a checked exception that is automatically enforced by the Handle or Declare Rule, you need to extend the Exception class.
You want to write a runtime exception, you need to extend the RuntimeException class.
----------------
Super keyword:
If the method overrides one of its superclass's methods, overridden method can be invoked through the use of the keyword super.
 It can be also used to refer to a hidden field and overridden methods.
-------------------
Packages are used in Java in-order to prevent naming conflicts.
An applet is a Java program that runs in a Web browser.
-----------------
Throw is used to trigger an exception where as throws is used in declaration of exception.
Without throws, Checked exception cannot be handled where as checked exception can be propagated with throws.
-----------------
JIT Complier:It improves the runtime performance of computer programs based on bytecode.
-----------
Object based programming languages follow all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. JavaScript is an example of object based programming languages.
------
Static block:It is used to initialize the static data member, It is excuted before main method at the time of classloading.
-----------
Holding the reference of the other class within some other class is known as composition.
----------------
Serialization is the process of writing the state of an object to a byte stream. 
Deserialization is the process of restoring these objects.
-------------
If you need to frequently add and remove elements from the middle of the list and only access the list elements sequentially, 
then LinkedList should be used. If you need to support random access, without inserting or removing elements from any place other than the end,
 then ArrayList should be used.
-------------------
Sockets provide the communication mechanism between two computers using TCP.
 --------------
Daemon thread is a low priority thread, which runs intermittently in the back ground doing the garbage collection operation for the java runtime system
------
Path and Classpath are operating system level environment variales. Path is defines where the system can find the executables(.exe) files and 
classpath is used to specify the location of .class files.
------------------
Reflection:Java Reflection is a process used to examine or modify the behavior of methods, classes, and interfaces at runtime. 
The Reflection API is mainly used in:
IDE (Integrated Development Environment) e.g., Eclipse, MyEclipse, NetBeans etc.
Debugger
Test Tools etc.
--------------------
Singleton Design Pattern:The singleton pattern is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object.

https://www.javatpoint.com/multithreading-in-java   :thread methods
Multithreading in Java is a process of executing multiple threads simultaneously. 
A thread is a lightweight sub-process.
Java Multithreading is mostly used in games, animation, etc.
Advantages of Java Multithreading
1) It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the same time.
2) You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
3) Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.

Multitasking
Multitasking is a process of executing multiple tasks simultaneously. 
We use multitasking to utilize the CPU. Multitasking can be achieved in two ways:
1.Process-based Multitasking (Multiprocessing)
A process is heavyweight.
Cost of communication between the process is high.
2.Thread-based Multitasking (Multithreading)
A thread is lightweight.
Cost of communication between the thread is low.

Can we start a thread twice?
No. After starting a thread, it can never be started again. Insuch case, thread will run once but for second time, it will throw exception. 
--------------------------------
Only a synchronized block or method can call the wait() method.	 And it is applied in multi  threading.
From any point or context in a program, you can call the sleep() method. Applied for single threads.
https://www.javatpoint.com/deadlock-in-java   ; Deadlock
----------------------------------------
A component of Java that decides which thread to run or execute and which thread to wait is called a thread scheduler in Java. 
There are two factors for scheduling a thread i.e. Priority and Time of arrival.
---------------------------
Typecasting in Java is the process of converting one data type to another data type using the casting operator. 

There are two types of Type Casting in java:

Widening Type Casting: A lower data type is transformed into a higher one by a process known as widening type casting. 
Narrow Type Casting: The process of downsizing a bigger data type into a smaller one is known as narrowing type casting.
------------------------------
The HashMap is non-thread-safe and can not be used in a Concurrent multi-threaded environment. Comparatively, ConcurrentHashMap
is a thread-safe and specially designed for use in multi-threaded and Concurrent environment.
--------------------------------------
Covariant return type refers to return type of an overriding method. It allows to narrow down return type of an overridden method without any
 need to cast the type or check the return type. Covariant return type works only for non-primitive return types.
From Java 5 onwards, we can override a method by changing its return type only by abiding the condition that return type is a subclass of that of overridden method return type.
. Non-Primitive Data Type or Object Data type: such as String, Array, etc.
----------------------------------------
Hash map
Tree map internally works?

------------------------
21) What is the synchronization?
Synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. It is used:

To prevent thread interference.
To prevent consistency problem.
When the multiple threads try to do the same task, there is a possibility of an erroneous result, hence to remove this issue, 
Java uses the process of synchronization which allows only one thread to be executed at a time. Synchronization can be achieved in three ways:

by the synchronized method
by synchronized block
by static synchronization
